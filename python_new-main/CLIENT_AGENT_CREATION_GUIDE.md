## üß™ **Testing Your New Agent**

### **Test Your Agent:**
1. Restart the system after saving `agents.json`

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Agent Not Responding**
- Check that your keywords are in the query

- Restart the system after changes

#### **Syntax Errors**
- Use a JSON validator online to check your syntax
