# 🖥️ Multi-Agent UI Response Display Instructions

## ✅ Updated UI - Now Shows Actual Agent Responses

The UI has been enhanced to **prominently display the actual content from each agent** instead of just orchestration metadata.

## 🚀 How to Test the Updated UI

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
python multi_agent_system.py
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:8003**

### 3. Register/Login
- Click **Register** and create an account
- Or login with existing credentials

### 4. Send Multi-Agent Query
Try this perfect test query:
```
best scenic, water and forest places in Maharashtra
```

## 🎯 What You'll See Now

### ✅ **Before (Old Display):**
- Just showed orchestration metadata
- Processing times and routing scores
- Minimal actual content

**2. Prominent Content Display:**
